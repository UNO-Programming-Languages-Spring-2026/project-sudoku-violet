% Hints:
% For subgrid of size n, subgrids can be identified by labels 1..n*n
% A cell (x,y) can be mapped to the subgrid labeled 1+(((x-1)/n)*n+(y-1)/n)

% Your implementation please...
% shows there shoud be numbers 1-4 in each row, column and number in them
row(1..9).
col(1..9).
number(1..9).
% makes sure a number is in each box
1 { sudoku(X, Y, N) : number(N) } 1 :- row(X), col(Y).
%makes sure numbers that are pre-filled don't add another number
sudoku(X, Y, N) :- initial(X, Y, N).
% same numbers can't be in same column
:- sudoku(X1, Y, N), sudoku(X2, Y, N), X1 != X2.
% same numbers can't be in same row
:- sudoku(X, Y1, N), sudoku(X, Y2, N), Y1 != Y2.

%modified differently than 4x4 since it would be way too long to do the other way but 
subgrid(X, Y, G) :- row(X), row(Y), G = 1+((X-1)/3) * 3 + ((Y-1)/3).
% puts it all together so we don't have to use subgrid/3
:- sudoku(X1, Y1, N), sudoku(X2, Y2, N), subgrid(X1, Y1, G), subgrid(X2, Y2, G), X1 != X2, Y1 != Y2.


#show sudoku/3.
